Python2 notes
=============

This repository is discontinued. The new repository is "Python_3_Examples_and_Notes".

These were intended to be reminders on how to code in Python 2 and for the SPSE. Whenever a refresh is needed the examples here were/are ready!

IDE used is "vim".

Looking for topics on linux:  ls -l | grep tuple

All examples should work without error. If you are brave you can try with the command "python *.py" ;>
